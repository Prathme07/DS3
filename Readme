# Receptionist

**Receptionist** is a web application designed to notify you when it's your turn for an interview, helping to manage and streamline virtual interview queues efficiently.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

**Receptionist** addresses these issues by:
- Showing a pop-up message when it's your turn.
- Sending an email notification when the interviewer invites you to join the meeting.
- Allowing you to check your position in the queue, so you can better plan your schedule.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Log in to the website using your registered email ID.
2. Check your position in the queue.
3. Wait for your turn and enjoy the smooth interview experience!
